# V2I-Vehicles-Communication-Application-with-LoRa-Module
Within the scope of the project, it is aimed to create an environment that will enable reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication of the sensor data collected from the mobile vehicle station and transfer it to the Road Side Unit (RSU) and cloud system. As sensor data, the vehicle's GPS data (latitude, longitude, speed, etc.) was taken instantly and sent to RSU. In order to realize V2I communication, Long Range (LoRa) technology, which performs long distance wireless data transmission with low power consumption, is used. The data collected in RSU is displayed instantly by transferring it to the AWS cloud system.
